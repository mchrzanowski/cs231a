Repo of the code I wrote for CS 231A. 

All code here is to:

	* perform the preprocessing step (located in src/matlab/)
	* perform the Mahalanobis training (almost all files in src/python/)
	* website real-time decision generation (on_demand.py)
	* NeuralNetwork training and testing written in Pybrain (src/python/neural_network_training_pybrain.py)
	* NeuralNetwork training and testing written for FANN (fast artificial Neural Network) (src/python/nn_train.py)
	* NeuralNetwork training and testing written in Theano (src/python/nn_theano.py)
	* NeuralNetwork training and testing written in Matlab (src/matlab/NeuralNetworkFaceVerification.m)
